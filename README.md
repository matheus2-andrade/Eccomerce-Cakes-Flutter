# Confectionary app

A new Flutter project.

I developed this bakery application with the objective of better fixing the modular structure that I've been studying, I also focused on state management using Mobx and Slidy's CLI.

The result of this turned out to be quite beautiful, since as the theme of the app, I decided to make this project of a small E-Commerce of a fictional bakery.

App developed with Flutter.

## I Used:
 - Mobx
 - Flutter Modular
